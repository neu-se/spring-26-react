# CS4530 Template Project

This is a template project for CS4530, Software Engineering at Northeastern.
It is part of a tree of template projects:

```

```

## Vite+Express configuration

The functional content of this project has two parts:

1.  A minimal Express transcript API for a very simple transcript server
2.  A Vite frontend with code that calls that server

The way this project runs in "production mode" versus "development mode" is
very different.

### Production Mode

Production mode is simpler: there's one server running, the Express server, on
port 3000, accessible via the url <http://localhost:3000>. When when a GET
request doesn't match any API endpoints, the Express server looks in
`./frontend/dist` to see if there's a file it can server there. Files are put
in that directory when `npm run build` calls the `vite build` command. This
build process is necessary because we're writing our frontend code in
TypeScript, but browsers can't do type stripping like Node can — we have to do
some transformation on the code we're writing to make it browser-friendly.
(Vite is doing a bunch of other transformations for other reasons.)

### Development Mode

Development mode is a little trickier, because we want our browser to be
connecting to Vite's "development web server", not Express, because Vite does
a lot of nifty stuff to make sure that when we change our TypeScript code, it
**reloads the web page**. That is _very_ handy for frontend web development.

However, this means your "frontend code" — the HTML and JS that the browser is
supposed to run being served by the Vite development web server — is coming
from a different server than the Express server running in React. The default
convention is that Vite development web server is accessed via
<http://localhost:5173>, and the Express API server is accessible via
<http://localhost:3000>. If you try to have a website that is being served
from a different port than the API service its using, you're going to have to
gain a nightmarish amount of literacy with
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS). This
wasn't a problem in production mode: your entire website is coming from the
Express server server. You really want your website look like it's _all_
coming from a single server during development too.

The easy way to do this is to have the development server _only_ respond to
API requests, and have the Vite development server forwards all API requests
to the Express server. This is called "proxying", and it means that you can
access a complete Vite server from <http://localhost:5173>.

### Express API

The Express server's API has the following endpoints:

| Endpoint             | Method | Description                         |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `/api/addStudent`    | POST   | Add a new student                   |
| `/api/addGrade`      | POST   | Add a grade for an existing student |
| `/api/getTranscript` | POST   | Look up information for a student   |

## Base configuration

### NPM Scripts

This sets up a set of commands that CS4530 templates should consistently
support:

- `npm run check` runs TypeScript
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint, and `npm run lint:fix` runs eslint with the
  `--fix` option
- `npm run prettier` checks formatting, and `npm run prettier:fix` writes
  formatted files back to disk
- `npm run test` runs Vitest tests and reports coverage
- `npm run dev` starts a development server or watch process
- `npm run build` prepares the project for production-style deployment
- `npm start` runs the project in production style

### ESLint

This base project has an opinionated ESLint configuration that relies on
[typed linting](https://typescript-eslint.io/getting-started/typed-linting).

- Frontend code is code that lives in `./frontend` or `./client`. This code
  supports a few different naming conventions, as suitable for React.
- Test code lives in a `**/tests` directory OR has a `*.spec.ts(x)` or a
  `*.test.ts(x)` filename. Tests can use devDependencies, unlike other code.
- Config files all have `*.config.mjs` filenames (vite, vitest, playwright,
  and eslint all follow this convention) and can import devDependencies,
  unlike other code. (Note that this means we're not using TypeScript to check
  our config files.)
- Most everything except for `no-console` and `prettier` should registered as
  `error`; it's distracting in practice to have these be red squigglies

### Minimalism, Mostly

Project configuration should be minimal, and deviations from this principle
should be justified and ideally documented. Notable exceptions are:

- `.gitignore`, which takes a kitchen-sink approach and should freely accept
  additions (for example, if a student accidentally checks in a file that
  could have been ignored)
- The ESLint configuration, which is a maximalist approach at trying to keep
  new TypeScript programmers on the rails in a complicated codebase, and also
  giving them a sense of working inside style conventions of a project that
  may differ from their own. (Rob has told students we banned `i++` with the
  `noPlusPlus` just to give them the experience of being annoyed by the style
  guide of a company they're working for. He may or may not have been
  kidding.)

### TypeScript

TypeScript in the project is configured with options that support
[type stripping](https://nodejs.org/api/typescript.html#type-stripping).
Beyond this, on top of regular strict settings, the TypeScript configuration
enables:

- `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`, to avoid osx/linux compatibility
  heartbreak
- `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` and `noImplicitReturns`, which are linter-like
  properties that don't seem to be supported by typed linting in ESLint
- `noUncheckedSideEffectImports`, which avoids an unexpected behavior

### Prettier

Includes a `.prettierrc` file with some reasonable settings and a
`.vscode/settings.json` file sets javascript, typescript, and json files to
use the prettier editor as the default.

NOTE 2026-01: In the future, this file could be made more minimal and
default-tuned in keeping with the minimalist principles: there's not an
obvious need to use non-default options for `jsxSingleQuote`, `quoteProps`,
`singleQuote`, `arrowParens`, and `bracketSameLine`.

### LF Line Endings

The `.prettierrc`, `.gitattributes`, and `.vscode/settings.json` files
conspire to generally force projects to use `\n` file endings instead of
Windows-style `\r\n` line endings (LF instead of CRLF).
